# Injury Screening and Prevention
### Overview:
Injury Screening and Prevention is an innovative project aimed at predicting and preventing injuries through advanced data analysis and machine learning algorithms. This project focuses on identifying patterns and risk factors associated with various types of injuries, enabling early intervention and targeted prevention strategies.

### Key Features:
Predictive Modeling: Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of different types of injuries based on relevant factors such as physical activity, environmental conditions, and personal health data.
Early Warning System: Implement an early warning system that alerts users and healthcare professionals about potential injury risks, allowing for timely preventive measures.
Data Visualization: Visualize injury trends and risk factors through interactive charts and graphs, providing insights into injury patterns over time.
Preventive Recommendations: Offer personalized recommendations to users, suggesting preventive measures and exercises tailored to their specific risk profile.
Technologies Used:
* Python: for data analysis, modeling, and backend development.
* Scikit-Learn: for machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling.
* Pandas and NumPy: for data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib and Plotly: for data visualization.
* Flask: for building a web-based interface for users.
* GitHub Actions: for continuous integration and deployment.
